### Document Your API Keys

Create `development/api-credentials-template.md`:

```markdown
# API Credentials (DO NOT COMMIT TO GIT)

## Google
- Project ID: [your-project-id]
- Client ID: [your-client-id]  
- GoogleService-Info.plist location: [path]

## Microsoft
- Application ID: [your-app-id]
- Directory/Tenant ID: [your-tenant-id]
- Redirect URI: msauth.com.yourname.adhdvoiceassistant://auth

## Setup Status
- [ ] Google Calendar API enabled
- [ ] Microsoft Graph permissions configured  
- [ ] iOS app bundle ID registered with both services
- [ ] Test authentication flows completed

## Notes
- Keep credentials in separate config file
- Never commit real credentials to GitHub
- Use environment variables for CI/CD
```

## 3. Design Your App Icon & Branding (30 mins)

### App Icon Concepts

Think about ADHD-friendly visual design:

- **Calming colors**: Blues, soft greens, avoid overwhelming reds
- **Simple shapes**: Not too complex for overstimulated brains
- **Voice metaphor**: Microphone, speech bubble, sound waves
- **Accessibility**: High contrast, works in dark mode

### Create Brand Guidelines

Create `design/brand-guidelines.md`:

```markdown
# ADHD Voice Assistant Brand Guidelines

## Color Palette
**Primary**: #4A90E2 (Calm Blue) - trustworthy, soothing
**Secondary**: #7ED321 (Success Green) - positive reinforcement  
**Accent**: #F5A623 (Warm Orange) - attention without alarm
**Background**: #F8F9FA (Soft White) - reduces eye strain
**Dark Mode**: #1C1C1E (iOS Dark) - OLED friendly

## Typography
**Primary**: SF Pro (iOS system font) - familiar, accessible
**Voice UI**: SF Pro Rounded - friendly, approachable
**Accessibility**: Minimum 16pt body text, 44pt touch targets

## Voice & Tone
- **Encouraging, never judgmental**
- **Clear and direct** (ADHD brains appreciate brevity)
- **Gentle error messages** (rejection sensitivity aware)
- **Celebration of wins** (dopamine-friendly)

## Accessibility Standards
- **Contrast ratio**: Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 44x44 points
- **Animation**: Respects reduce motion preferences
- **VoiceOver**: Descriptive but not verbose labels
```
